# SCUMM-L Enhanced

A Next-Generation LLM-Powered Interactive Fiction Engine

## What is This?

SCUMM-L Enhanced is a text adventure engine powered by advanced LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc) designed for immersive, dynamic storytelling, emergent gameplay, and rich simulation. It uses a design document (`Scumm_l.txt`) detailing its world model, narration style, input parsing, NPC behavior, puzzles, and more.
